# Communication between Systems - REST, GRPC, GraphQL, Service Discovery, Consul (Currently Studying)

## Synchronous Communication: 
- Real Time
- Send a request and receive a response in the right time

## Asynchronous Communication:
- You do not need the answer in the right time
- Commonly we can work this way with microservices
- You send the message to a separated system and this system will be responsible for the delivery (message broker: Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- You do not depend on microservices
